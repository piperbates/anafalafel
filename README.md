# Anafalafel
## A receipe app for allergy sufferers

This is a recipe app built using the Edamam API, where users can filter out ingredients or select dietary requirements and search from thousands of recipes. 

Currently in development. 

Eventually want this to be a platform where users can log in and save their favourite recipes, build meal plans that show a shopping list based on those meal plans, and nutritional information for their daily recipes.
